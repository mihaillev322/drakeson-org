<h1>About Drakes On: source-led guidance on drakes and care</h1>

<section>
<h2>Mission and Audience</h2>
<p>Drakes On exists to clarify what is a drake across multiple contexts—from the male duck in ornithology to dragon-like reptiles in fantasy literature and folklore, and the various reptilian species that share drake-like characteristics. Our mission is to provide international, accessible guidance that translates complex husbandry principles into practical checklists for enthusiasts, educators, and responsible owners worldwide.</p>
<p>We recognise that the term "drake" carries different meanings depending on context. For waterfowl enthusiasts, it denotes male ducks such as mallards and wood ducks. For reptile keepers and fantasy literature readers, it evokes scaled, dragon-like creatures. Our content bridges these contexts, comparing types of drakes and offering welfare-focused care information grounded in established veterinary and zoological principles.</p>
<p>Our audience is international. We avoid region-specific legal claims and instead encourage readers to consult local wildlife authorities and veterinary professionals. Whether you are researching drake characteristics for educational purposes, considering responsible ownership, or simply curious about the terminology, Drakes On provides a foundation built on clarity, evidence, and respect for animal welfare.</p>

<h2>Editorial Method and Sourcing</h2>
<h3>How We Build Content</h3>
<p>Every page on Drakes On is developed through a structured editorial process. We begin by consulting primary sources: peer-reviewed veterinary journals, zoological databases, and publications from reputable conservation organisations. When discussing drake habitat requirements, drake diet and feeding, or drake health and diseases, we draw on established husbandry guidelines used by accredited zoos, wildlife rehabilitators, and exotic veterinarians.</p>
<p>We prioritise transparency. Where scientific consensus is strong—such as the importance of temperature gradients for reptile thermoregulation—we state it clearly. Where uncertainty exists, or where "drake" terminology blends folklore with biology, we label it as such. We do not invent species names or present speculative care advice as fact.</p>
<h3>External Authority Links</h3>
<p>To support our readers' further research, we link to authoritative organisations. For global health and welfare standards, we reference the <a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="external">World Health Organization</a>. For species information and natural history, we recommend <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/" rel="external">National Geographic</a>. These resources provide additional depth and international perspectives that complement our guidance.</p>
<h3>Review and Updates</h3>
<p>Our editorial team reviews content quarterly to incorporate new research, update care recommendations, and refine keyword integration for discoverability. We welcome corrections and suggestions from veterinarians, herpetologists, ornithologists, and experienced keepers.</p>
